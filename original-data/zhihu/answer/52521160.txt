為什麽外企全是中國HR卻喜歡要求職者交英文簡歷？
No, you have some misunderstandings. Typing and reading in English actually saves energy and time for both sides. <br><br>Secondly, layout and alignments for English resumes are neat and tidy for intensive technical terms.<br><br>Something also important to me is that, while writing in English, applicants tend to have less bullshits.
