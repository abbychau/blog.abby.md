如何看待 Rust Actix 库的维护者退出开源界？
<p>好好善待maintainer。</p><p>我有時候覺得，github 裡面issue 這個字太負面了。導致提issue 的人天然上感覺到地位。（老子幫你找出問題你應該感謝我）</p><p>其實源碼早就放出來，如果我的readme 甚麼都不寫，是bug 還是feature 還是我說了算的。</p><p>For example, async/await took three weeks 12 hours/day work stint, quite exhausting, and what happened after release, I started to receive complaints that docs are not updated and i have to go fix my shit. Encouraging. You could notice after each unsafe shitstorm, i started to spend less and less time with the community. You felt betrayed after you put so much effort and then to hear all this shit comments, even if you understand that that is usual internet behavior. Anyway, removing issue was a stupid idea. But I was pissed off with last two personal comments, especially while sitting and thinking how to solve the problem. I am sorry for doing that.</p><p>好心痛啊。。。</p><p>他現在已經不單是死心，而是有一點想報復了。（不找繼任，不開sponsor，不archive 直接刪庫）</p><p>雖然不是主因，但如果github把issue 改為request 的話，說不定風氣會改善一點。</p>
