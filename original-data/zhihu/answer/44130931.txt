removed some of the technical problems in BCPL.</p></blockquote><br><a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//stackoverflow.com/questions/18125490/how-was-the-first-c-compiler-written" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">assembly - How was the first C compiler written ?</a>
