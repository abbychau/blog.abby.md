Smile.dk 的其中一首較新的曲  
我真的很喜歡bubblegum 呢  
  
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Koko Soko Asoko  
where are you my heart  
Koko Soko Asoko  
can't find you in the dark  
  
i'm looking for a friend  
who is lost in the dark  
can you help me find him  
he has lost his heart  
  
when he looks at me  
he tries to tell me where he is  
but I can't here please tell me now  
what is it that I miss  
  
Koko Soko Asoko  
where are you my heart  
Koko Soko Asoko  
can't find you in the dark  
Koko Soko Asoko  
please let me find you now  
Koko Soko Asoko  
then I try with this sound  
  
Ladidadidaida ladidaida  
Ladidadidaida ladidaida  
Ladidadidaida ladidaida  
Ladidadidaida ladidaida  
  
He tries to let me now\*  
you gotta listen to your soul\*  
find out what’s inside\*  
than you gotta find this whole \*  
i'm sitting there and wait for you\*  
I want to be found\*  
than we can play all night long\*  
and make more of these sounds\*</span>
