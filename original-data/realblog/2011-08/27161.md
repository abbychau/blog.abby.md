 Music surrounds me on this special night  
 I find myself getting lost in the moment  
 'Cause she's there dancing and you're in my sight  
   
 You're stepping along  
 Can't get my eyes off of you  
 Then I see you're looking back . at me  
 Could this be what I think it is?  
 Can feel my heart beat like a new butterfly  
   
 I know you've got to be the one  
 I could tell when our eyes met each other  
 I can't sit down my knees are feelin' weak  
 As I feel myself at last  
   
 You've got the cutest little smile  
 We can tell there's attraction going on now  
 Shows you're all that I need  
 One by one  
 For our love  
 You are my prince charming  
 And you make me feel like I am a KIMONO♥PRINCESS  
   
 I'm not dreaming  
 I know you've got to be the one  
 I could tell when our eyes met each other  
 I can't sit down my knees are feelin' weak  
 And I feel myself at last  
   
 You've got the cutest little smile  
 We can tell there's attraction going on now  
 Shows you're all that I need  
 One by one  
 For our love  
 You are my prince charming  
 And you make me feel like I am a KIMONO♥PRINCESS</span>
