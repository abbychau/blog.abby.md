[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is my primary text editor, as it offers a huge amount of features, and yet remains fairly simple to use. After months of using it heavily both at home and at work, I began to wonder if I could launch multiple instances of it at one time. Given that I have two monitors in either case, I thought it would be interesting to have one Notepad++ window per monitor.

The best approach I found makes a new copy of Notepad++ launch every time you use a shortcut. To make this work on your machine, simply do the following:[![How to configure Notepad++ to launch a new copy of itself every time](http://mattrefghi.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/MultiInst.png)](http://mattrefghi.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/MultiInst.png)

1. Right-click any Notepad++ shortcut.
2. Select *Properties*.
3. Move to the *Shortcut* tab.
4. In the end of the *Target* field, add ” -multiInst”.
5. Click *OK*.

Example:

- Target: “C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe” **-multiInst**

You might be wondering at this point, what if I’m already using Notepad++, do I still have to use the shortcut to launch another? Thankfully, no. To launch another instance when already using the editor, you can simply press <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>F6</kbd>, or Click *Run* -&gt; *Open in another instance* in the menu bar.
