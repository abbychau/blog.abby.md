title: .htaccess - Allow Only By Referer

Good afternoon-  
  
I have browsed the forums as well as the web looking for an answer to this question. Hope someone out there can help.   
  
I need to create a .htaccess file that will only allow the files in the folder to be seen if the "referer" is from a particular site (or possibly two sites). I have found a lot of solutions out there for people who want to block specific sites, but I can't seem to figure out how to only allow specific sites. I have done some trial and error based on some of the things I have found, but with no luck.  
  
Any ideas?  
  
Thanks in advance!  
  
David

Hi David,   
  
Welcome to the forums   
  
I haven't tested it, but try;

RewriteEngine on  
RewriteBase /  
RewriteCond %{HTTP\_REFERER} !^http://www\\.your\_domain\_name\\.com/ \[NC\]  
RewriteCond %{HTTP\_REFERER} !^http://www\\.OKdomain1\\.com/ \[NC\]  
RewriteCond %{HTTP\_REFERER} !^http://www\\.OKdomain2\\.com/ \[NC\]  
RewriteRule ^.\*$ http://www.your\_domain\_name.com/not\_allowed\_here.htm \[R=301,L\]

or I'd try something along those lines anyway - with the not\_allowed\_here.htm being a page I redirected all those I don't want to.
