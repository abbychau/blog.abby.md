I don't mean to write my diary in English, yet writing Chinese on iPod is just a nightmare.  
  
Last time I write my diary on my bed is years ago. I suppose there should be 5 years or 6. Everytime I try to do this again I can't swipe the memory of her. I write diary everyday in those days, on a physical book instead of the popular xanga.   
  
The memory is always to be too precious to make me redoing it. I don't know what I am talking about, though.  
  
I don't suppose to feel it again. When I am typing on this blog, I totally enjoy...like years ago.
