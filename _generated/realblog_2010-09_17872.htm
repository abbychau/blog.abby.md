A programmer is walking along a beach and finds a lamp. He rubs the lamp, and a genie appears. “I am the most powerful genie in the world. I can grant you any wish, but only one wish.”<br />
The programmer pulls out a map, points to it and says, “I’d want peace in the Middle East.”<br />
The genie responds, “Gee, I don’t know. Those people have been fighting for millenia. I can do just about anything, but this is likely beyond my limits.”<br />
The programmer then says, “Well, I am a programmer, and my programs have lots of users. Please make all my users satisfied with my software and let them ask for sensible changes.”<br />
At which point the genie responds, “Um, let me see that map again.”<br />

The first student responds, “Good choice! Her clothes probably wouldn’t have fit you.”<br />

Why computers are like men:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they are the problem.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10px;">Why computers are like women:</span>1. <span style="font-size:10px;">No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.</span></p>

Laws of Computer Programming</span>1. <span style="font-size:10px;">Any given program, when running, is obsolete.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">Any given program costs more and takes longer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">Any program will expand to fill available memory.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">The value of a program is proportional to the weight of its output.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capabilities of the programmer who must maintain it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">Any non-trivial program contains at least one bug.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which by definition are limited.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10px;">A programmer finds himself in front of a committee that decides whether he should go to Heaven or Hell. The committee tells the programmer he has a say in the matter and asks him if he wants to see either Heaven or Hell before stating his preference.<br />
“Sure,” the programmer replies. “I have a pretty good idea what Heaven is like, so let’s see Hell.” So an angel takes the programmer to a sunny beach, full of beautiful women in skimpy bikinis playing volleyball, listening to music and having a great time. “Wow!” he exclaims, “Hell looks great! I’ll take Hell!”<br />
Instantly the programmer finds himself in red-hot lava with demons tearing at his flesh. “Where’s the beach? The music? The women?” he screams frantically to the angel.<br />
“That was the demo,” the angel replies as she vanishes.  </p>
<pre><code>Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer. This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a contest with God as the judge. They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours straight.  
Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over. He asks Satan to show his work. Visibly upset, Satan cries and says, “I have nothing. I lost it all when the power went out.”  
“Very well,” says God, “let us see if Jesus has fared any better.”  
Jesus presses a key, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers.   
Satan is astonished. He stutters, “B-b-but how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus’ program is intact! How did he do it?”  
God chuckles, “Everybody knows… Jesus saves.”  </code></pre>

1. &lt;span style="font-size:10px;"&gt;Newly-assembled programming team fixes almost all of the 137 bugs, but introduce 456 new ones.&lt;/span&gt;

1. &lt;span style="font-size:10px;"&gt;Original programmer sends underpaid testing department a postcard from Fiji. Entire testing department quits.&lt;/span&gt;

1. &lt;span style="font-size:10px;"&gt;Company is bought in a hostile takeover by competitor using profits from their latest release, which had 783 bugs.&lt;/span&gt;

1. &lt;span style="font-size:10px;"&gt;New CEO is brought in by board of directors. He hires a programmer to redo program from scratch.&lt;/span&gt;

The programmer compiled an array of reasons as to why he can’t find a girlfriend with a good &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt; on her &amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;, reason 0 being that he has limited cache. So he searches his memory to recall connecting to the TCP/IP tunnel of his last girlfriend — sometimes even without a secure socket. His last girlfriend always complained about his lack of comments. He fumed, “I hate commenting!” Realizing it was a program requirement, he told her she had nice bits. This resulted in a Syntax Error. Now she demanded a massage, but this was rejected as “Feature Creep.” He smacked her back-end and shouted, “Who’s your parent node?!” He scanned for open ports. He attempted to install a backdoor worm but her response was 403. While his data uploaded into her input device, she considered terminating the process. But instead she initiated a Do While loop where she recalled a previous boyfriend with a larger pointer. To expedite the routine routine, she screamed, “Hack into my system! Hack deep into my system! You’re 1337, baby!” This caused his stack to overflow, and he shot his GUI on her interface. ([Source](http://www.hogwild.net/Rants/computer-programming-jokes-girlfriend.htm))  </code></pre>
