<p>Most of the world use Windows computers, so the chances are you’re one of them. So if you want to produce music on your computer, what are your options? Fortunately there are a heap of them – most of the big name digital audio workstation software works fine on Windows, and they’re not your only choices. So sit down and take a menu. We list the “big gun” software you can choose from, some inexpensive (less than $100) alternatives, and a few free options.<br />
<span id="more-8997" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br />
Sometimes the last thing you need when you’re making a choice is more options! But personally I prefer to know what the alternatives are before making up my mind – especially when it potentially costs a lot of money. I’d really appreciate comments of your own experiences. Feel free to let us know which programs you’ve used, how easy they were to get your mind around, and whether they have the features you needed. I’ll add many of your comments to the 2012 version of the list.</p>

<h2>The Big Guns</h2>
<p>If you’re serious about producing music, you’ll want to invest in the best software you can afford. Here are eleven of the top DAWs, ranging in price from $200 all the way up to $1000. We start with the DAWs we tend to focus on here at Audiotuts+ (the only one missing is Apple’s Logic Pro, which only works on Macs), then branch out to six other popular and powerful alternatives – including a few that are relatively new.</p>
<h3>Avid <a href="http://www.avid.com/US/products/Pro-Tools-Software">Pro Tools 9</a></h3>

“Power, creativity, and flexibility in the world’s most advanced audio production platform.”

“Whether you’re in a professional facility, home studio, or on the road, nothing gives you the quality, speed, capability, ease, and inspiration to create like Pro Tools, the most widely used audio creation/production system in the industry. With Pro Tools 9, you can compose, record, edit, and mix music and sound for picture the way you want—with a high-performance Avid audio interface or without, on a Mac or PC, and with more flexibility than ever.”

With Pro Tools 9 you no longer need to purchase Digidesign or M-Audio hardware in order to get it. There is now a software-only option, which is great news.

Great DAWs for Less than $100
-----------------------------

If you’re just starting out, or are on a tight budget, then you may not be ready to fork out $1000 for a software program – or even $200. Here are seven great quality apps that you can pick up for less than $100 (or just over $100 in one case).

### Cockos [REAPER 3](http://www.reaper.fm/)

<div class="tutorial_image" style="margin: 0px 0px 30px; padding: 20px 20px 15px; border: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: hidden;">![](http://d3vvl31cy8gagb.cloudfront.net/534_windowsdaws/reaper.png)</div>$150 (full commercial license) or $40 (discounted license)

“Audio production without limits.”

“REAPER is a digital audio workstation: a complete multitrack audio and MIDI recording, editing, processing, mixing, and mastering environment.”

“REAPER is designed to let you work quickly and creatively, without imposing any artificial limits on what you can do. REAPER doesn’t have track types, busses, tools, or offline processing. If you want to create a drum bus, simply add a track above the drum tracks and press the folder button – the drums will automatically send to the folder, Once you get the drum levels and FX tweaked right where you want them, you can record the folder’s output to non-destructively freeze the drums and move on. ”

### [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/)

<div class="tutorial_image" style="margin: 0px 0px 30px; padding: 20px 20px 15px; border: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow: hidden;">![](http://d3vvl31cy8gagb.cloudfront.net/534_windowsdaws/renoise.png)</div>Costs 58 EUR

For Free!
---------

I enjoy checking out free software and comparing it with the more expensive alternatives, and have become very impressed with the quality of free software. Here are a few apps that cost nothing, but look like they perform admirably well. If you’ve tried any of them, please let us know your opinion in the comments.

### [Traverso DAW](http://traverso-daw.org/)
